# BDB_Gloves_Client
A Windows client written in C# which allows BLE messages and Motion Capture data to send MIDI note messages out to any audio software. 

V 0.75 Bugs:
- Currently, connection to BLE devices is inconsistent, the latency when using motion detection is poor, and the program crashes due to
  the absence of garbage collection regarding the BLE data. These bugs are planned to be fixed in future revisions, but the project has
  been put to the side at this time.
